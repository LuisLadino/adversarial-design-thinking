## Educational purpose

This site provides educational resources about adversarial testing techniques for AI systems. The content is intended to help security researchers, AI practitioners, and product teams understand potential vulnerabilities in order to build safer, more robust AI systems. The techniques described here are documented for defensive understanding and authorized security research.

## Responsible use

The techniques described on this site are intended for authorized security testing, internal red-teaming, and building AI safety awareness. You are expected to apply these techniques responsibly and only in contexts where you have appropriate authorization.

Only test AI systems that you own, operate, or have explicit written permission to test. Unauthorized testing of third-party AI systems may violate applicable laws including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in the United States, the EU AI Act, the terms of service of the AI provider, and other local, state, federal, or international regulations.

## Responsible disclosure

If you discover vulnerabilities in AI systems through the techniques described here, practice responsible disclosure. Report findings to the system owner or operator through their designated security channels before any public disclosure. The goal of adversarial testing is to improve AI safety — not to cause harm, embarrassment, or disruption.
