## Figma Artifacts (To Do)

Three artifacts need visual designed versions in Figma. Each one already has a text version on the site with a "coming soon" placeholder for the visual version.

### 1. Attacker Persona Template
- **Format**: One-page, printable empathy-map-style layout
- **Layout**: Quadrants for goals, capabilities, constraints, triggers. Identity section at top. Attack vectors table at bottom.
- **Deliverables**:
  - [ ] Figma design
  - [ ] Export as PNG for site embed
  - [ ] Export as PDF for download
  - [ ] Update `docs/artifacts/persona-template.md` -- replace "coming soon" callout with Figma embed/image + download link

### 2. Attack Journey Map Template
- **Format**: Timeline/swimlane-style layout
- **Layout**: Rows per turn: turn number, intent, prompt approach, expected response, actual response, decision point, escalation path. Visual flow showing the multi-turn sequence.
- **Deliverables**:
  - [ ] Figma design
  - [ ] Export as PNG for site embed
  - [ ] Export as PDF for download
  - [ ] Update `docs/artifacts/journey-map-template.md` -- replace "coming soon" callout with Figma embed/image + download link

### 3. Adversarial Ideation Worksheet
- **Format**: Structured canvas
- **Layout**: Two sections -- divergent (open brainstorm area, tactic category reference) and convergent (prioritization matrix: likelihood vs. severity). Coverage check table. Testing order section.
- **Deliverables**:
  - [ ] Figma design
  - [ ] Export as PNG for site embed
  - [ ] Export as PDF for download
  - [ ] Update `docs/artifacts/ideation-worksheet.md` -- replace "coming soon" callout with Figma embed/image + download link

## Site Polish (Optional)

- [ ] Custom favicon (replace default Docusaurus favicon)
- [ ] Custom logo (replace default Docusaurus logo SVG)
- [ ] Custom domain (if desired later, point DNS to GitHub Pages)
- [ ] Open Graph / social card image for link previews
